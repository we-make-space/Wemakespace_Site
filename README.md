## Per-Page SEO Images

Each page has its own Open Graph image for link previews. When someone shares a URL (e.g. `/contact`), the preview image will be unique to that page.

- Add images to `client/public/og-images/` (recommended size: 1200×630px)
- See `client/public/og-images/README.md` for the file naming convention
- Until custom images are added, `opengraph.jpg` is used as fallback

---

## Database Setup

Content (articles, platforms, team, testimonials) is managed via **Supabase**. To set up:

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run `supabase-schema.sql` in the SQL Editor
3. Add your credentials to `.env`
4. Populate tables via the Supabase dashboard

See [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed steps.
